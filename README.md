Overview
========

This is a set of [Chef](https://github.com/opscode/chef) cookbooks to bring up
an [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org) or [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/)
cluster. In addition to hosting virtual machines, there are a number of
additional services provided with these cookbooks - such as distributed
storage, DNS, log aggregation/search, and monitoring - see below for a partial
list of services provided by these cookbooks.

The various envisioned deployment types can be seen in ![Image depicting VirtualBox cluster, OpenStack cluster, hardware cluster with VirtualBox bootstrap or purely hardware cluster.][BCPC Node Types.svg]

OpenStack
---------

Each OpenStack head node runs all of the core services in a highly-available
manner with no restriction upon how many head nodes there are.  The cluster
is deemed operational as long as 50%+1 of the head nodes are online. 
Otherwise, a network partition may occur with a split-brain scenario. 
In practice, we currently recommend roughly one head node per rack.

Each worker node runs the relevant services (nova-compute, Ceph OSDs, etc.).
There is no limitation on the number of worker nodes.  In practice, we
currently recommend that the cluster should not grow to more than 200 worker
nodes.

Hadoop
------

Each Hadoop head node is Hadoop component specific. The roles are intended to
be run so that they can be layered in a highly-available manner. E.g. multiple
BCPC-Hadoop-Head-``*`` machines will correctly build a MySQL, Zookeeper, HDFS
JournalNode, etc. cluster and deploy the named component as well. Further,
for components which support HA, the intention is one can simply add the
role to multiple machines and the right thing will be done to support HA
(except in the case of HDFS).

To setup HDFS HA, please follow the following model from your Bootstrap VM:
* Install the cluster once with a non-HA HDFS:
  - with a BCPC-Hadoop-Head-Namenode-NoHA role
  - with the following node variable [:bcpc][:hadoop][:hdfs][:HA] = false
  - ensure at least three machines are installed with BCPC-Hadoop-Head roles
  - ensure at least one machine is a datanode
  - run ``cluster-assign-roles.sh <Environment> Hadoop`` successfully
* Re-configure the cluster with an HA HDFS:
  - change the BCPC-Hadoop-Head-Namenode-NoHA machine's role to
    BCPC-Hadoop-Head-Namenode
  - set the following node variable [:bcpc][:hadoop][:hdfs][:HA] = true on
    all nodes (e.g. in the environment)
  - run ``cluster-assign-roles.sh <Environment> Hadoop`` successfully

Setup
=====

These recipes are currently intended for building a BCPC cloud on top of
Ubuntu 12.04 servers using Chef 11. When setting this up in VMs, be sure to
add a few dedicated disks (for ceph OSDs) aside from boot volume. In
addition, it's expected that you have three separate NICs per machine, with
the following as defaults (and recommendations for VM settings):
 - ``eth0`` - management traffic (host-only NIC in VM)
 - ``eth1`` - storage traffic (host-only NIC in VM)
 - ``eth2`` - VM traffic (host-only NIC in VM)

You should look at the various settings in ``cookbooks/bcpc/attributes/default.rb``
and tweak accordingly for your setup (by adding them to an environment file).

Cluster Bootstrap
-----------------

The provided scripts which sets up a Chef and Cobbler server via
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) permits imaging of the cluster via PXE.

Once the Chef server is set up, you can bootstrap any number of nodes to get
them registered with the Chef server for your environment - see the next
section for enrolling the nodes.

Make a cluster
--------------

To build a new BCPC cluster, you have to start with building a head nodes
first. (This assumes that you have already completed the bootstrap process and
have a Chef server available.)  Since the recipes will automatically generate
all passwords and keys for this new cluster, the nodes must temporarily become
``admin``'s in the chef server, so that the recipes can write the generated info
to a databag.  The databag will be called ``configs`` and the databag item will
be the same name as the environment (``Test-Laptop`` in this example). You only
need to leave the node as an ``admin`` for the first chef-client run. You can
also manually create the databag & item (as per the example in
``data_bags/configs/Example.json``) and manually upload it if you'd rather not
bother with the whole ``admin`` thing for the first run.

So, to add this machine a role, one can update the ``cluster.txt`` file and ensure
all necessary information is provided as per [cluster-readme.txt](./cluster-readme.txt).

Alternatively, using the script [tests/automated_install.sh](./tests/automated_install.sh),
one can run through what is the expected "happy-path" install. This simple
install supports only changing DNS, proxy and VM resource settings. (This is
the basis of our automated build tests.)

Using an OpenStack cluster
--------------------------

Once the nodes are configured and bootstrapped, BCPC services will be
accessible via the floating IP.  (For the Test-Laptop environment, it is
10.0.100.5.)

For example, you can go to ``https://10.0.100.5/horizon/`` for the OpenStack
web interface.  To find the automatically-generated OpenStack credentials, look
in the data bag for your environment under ``keystone-admin-user`` and
``keystone-admin-password``:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~$ knife data bag show configs Test-Laptop | grep keystone-admin
keystone-admin-password:       abcdefgh
keystone-admin-token:          this-is-my-token
keystone-admin-user:           admin

```

For example, to check on ``Ceph``:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-vm1:~$ ceph -s
   health HEALTH_OK
   monmap e1: 1 mons at {bcpc-vm1=172.16.100.11:6789/0}, election epoch 2, quorum 0 bcpc-vm1
   osdmap e94: 12 osds: 12 up, 12 in
    pgmap v705: 2192 pgs: 2192 active+clean; 80333 KB data, 729 MB used, 227 GB / 227 GB avail
   mdsmap e4: 1/1/1 up {0=bcpc-vm1=up:active}
```
